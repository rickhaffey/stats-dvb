    "* b) It would mean that given a movie of 0 minutes, the cost of the movie would be \\$-64 million.  This is clearly outside the range of movies used as input to the model, and reflects a \"non-sensical\" value.  Starting at 62.35 minutes runtime, the cost would be $0 - so this model is clearly only applicable to some range of runtimes _above_ 62 minutes in run-length.\n",
